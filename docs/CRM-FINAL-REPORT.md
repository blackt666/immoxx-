## Lead Scoring System

### Point Values
- Property view: +10 points
- Phone call: +25 points
- Email sent: +5 points
- Meeting scheduled: +30 points
- Viewing scheduled: +40 points
- Offer made: +50 points
- Document signed: +60 points

### Temperature Classification
- **Hot** (≥80 points): Immediate follow-up required, high conversion probability
- **Warm** (50-79 points): Active engagement, moderate conversion probability
- **Cold** (<50 points): Early stage, low conversion probability

### Automatic Updates
Temperature is automatically recalculated when lead score changes via SQL trigger:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_lead_temperature
AFTER UPDATE OF score ON crm_leads
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE crm_leads
  SET temperature = CASE
    WHEN NEW.score >= 80 THEN 'hot'
    WHEN NEW.score >= 50 THEN 'warm'
    ELSE 'cold'
  END
  WHERE id = NEW.id;
END;
```

## Pipeline Stages

1. **inbox** - New unprocessed lead
2. **contacted** - Initial contact made
3. **qualified** - Lead qualified, budget confirmed
4. **viewing_scheduled** - Property viewing arranged
5. **offer_made** - Offer submitted to lead
6. **negotiation** - Price/terms negotiation in progress
7. **won** - Deal closed successfully
8. **lost** - Lead lost (competitor, budget, timing)

## API Testing Results

### ✅ All Endpoints Tested Successfully

```bash
# Test 1: Get all leads
curl http://localhost:5001/api/crm/v2/leads
# Result: ✅ Returned 5 leads, sorted by score (95, 88, 65, 58, 25)

# Test 2: Filter hot leads
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/crm/v2/leads?temperature=hot"
# Result: ✅ Returned 2 leads (Maximilian: 95, Dr. Steinmann: 88)

# Test 3: Get activities
curl http://localhost:5001/api/crm/v2/activities
# Result: ✅ Returned 5 activities (calls, emails, viewing)

# Test 4: Get tasks
curl http://localhost:5001/api/crm/v2/tasks

## Bug Fixes During Implementation

### Bug 1: Module Import Error
**Issue**: `Cannot find module 'server/database/index.json'`
**Cause**: Incorrect import path in leadService.ts
**Fix**: Changed from `import { db } from "../../database"` to `import { db } from "../../db"`
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Bug 2: PostgreSQL Syntax in SQLite
**Issue**: `unrecognized token: "::"`
**Cause**: Using PostgreSQL type casting `count(*)::int` in SQLite
**Fix**: Changed to `count(*)` without type cast
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Bug 3: UUID Generation
**Issue**: PostgreSQL `gen_random_uuid()` not available in SQLite
**Fix**: Used `lower(hex(randomblob(16)))` for ID generation
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
