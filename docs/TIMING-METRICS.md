# Calendar Sync Timing Metrics

## Overview

The ImmoXX platform now includes comprehensive timing metrics for calendar synchronization operations. These metrics help monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal system operation.

## Features

### 1. Sync Operation Timing

Every calendar sync operation now tracks timing information at multiple levels:

- **Connection Test**: Time to verify calendar connection
- **CRM-to-Calendar**: Time to sync appointments from CRM to calendar
- **Calendar-to-CRM**: Time to sync events from calendar to CRM
- **Total Operation**: Overall sync duration

### 2. Individual Operation Tracking

Each Google Calendar API operation tracks:
- `createEvent`: Time to create calendar events
- `updateEvent`: Time to update calendar events
- `deleteEvent`: Time to delete calendar events
- `getEvents`: Time to fetch calendar events

### 3. Performance Statistics

The system maintains a rolling history of the last 100 operations and provides:

- **Average Duration**: Mean execution time across all operations
- **Min/Max Duration**: Fastest and slowest operations
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Per-Operation Breakdown**: Statistics grouped by operation type

## Usage

### View Timing in Logs

Timing information is automatically logged to the console:

```
Sync completed for connection 1: SUCCESS (2 created, 1 updated, 0 deleted, 0 skipped, 0 errors) - Timing: 1234ms (test: 45ms, crmToCalendar: 567ms, calendarToCrm: 622ms)
```

```
[GoogleCalendar Timing] createEvent: 234ms (success)
```

### API Endpoint

Access timing statistics via the API:

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/calendar/stats/timing`

**Authentication:** Required (admin/agent)

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "averageMs": 245.6,
    "minMs": 123,
    "maxMs": 567,
    "totalOperations": 42,
    "successRate": 0.95,
    "byOperation": {
      "createEvent": {
        "count": 15,
        "averageMs": 234.5,
        "successRate": 0.93
      },
      "updateEvent": {
        "count": 12,
        "averageMs": 198.3,
        "successRate": 1.0
      },
      "deleteEvent": {
        "count": 8,
        "averageMs": 145.2,
        "successRate": 1.0
      },
      "getEvents": {
        "count": 7,
        "averageMs": 456.7,
        "successRate": 1.0
      }
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T17:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Typical Operation Times

- **Connection Test**: 50-200ms
- **Create Event**: 100-300ms
- **Update Event**: 100-250ms
- **Delete Event**: 80-200ms
- **Get Events**: 200-800ms (depends on date range)

### Full Sync Operations

- **Small Dataset (1-10 appointments)**: 1-3 seconds
- **Medium Dataset (10-50 appointments)**: 3-10 seconds
- **Large Dataset (50+ appointments)**: 10-30 seconds

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check timing statistics weekly to establish baselines
2. **Performance Degradation**: Investigate if average times increase by >50%
3. **Success Rate**: Maintain success rate above 95%
4. **Slow Operations**: Investigate operations taking >1000ms consistently

## Troubleshooting

### High Average Times

If you notice consistently high average times:

1. Check network connectivity to Google Calendar API
2. Verify API rate limits aren't being hit
3. Review the number of appointments being synced
4. Consider optimizing sync frequency

### Low Success Rate

If success rate drops below 90%:

1. Check token expiration issues
2. Verify calendar permissions
3. Review error logs for specific failures
4. Ensure calendar connection is active

## Implementation Details

### Calendar Sync Service

The `calendarSyncService.ts` tracks timing for:
- Full sync operations
- Individual sync phases (test, CRM→Calendar, Calendar→CRM)

### Google Calendar Service

The `googleCalendarService.ts` maintains:
- Operation history (last 100 operations)
- Per-operation timing and success tracking
- Statistical analysis methods

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for timing metrics:

- [ ] Persistent storage of timing data
- [ ] Trend analysis and anomaly detection
- [ ] Performance dashboards in admin UI
- [ ] Automated alerts for performance degradation
- [ ] Integration with monitoring services (Datadog, New Relic)
