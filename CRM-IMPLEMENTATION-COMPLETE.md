## 📊 System Architecture

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Posteingang** (Inbox) - New leads
2. **Kontaktiert** (Contacted) - First contact made
3. **Qualifiziert** (Qualified) - Budget & timeline confirmed
4. **Besichtigung** (Viewing) - Viewing scheduled
5. **Angebot** (Offer) - Offer made
6. **Verhandlung** (Negotiation) - In negotiation
7. **Gewonnen** (Won) - Deal closed
8. **Verloren** (Lost) - Deal lost

### Lead Scoring Algorithm
```
Property View:        +10 points
Email Open:           +5 points
Email Click:          +15 points
Form Submission:      +20 points
Phone Call:           +25 points
Meeting:              +30 points
Viewing Scheduled:    +35 points
Offer Sent:           +40 points
Budget > €500k:       +20 points
Timeline < 3 months:  +15 points

Hot:  Score ≥ 80
Warm: Score 50-79
Cold: Score < 50
```
