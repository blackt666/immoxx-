# Build Script Fix Summary

## Problem

The build was failing during deployment on Vercel with the following error sequence:

1. `npm install` runs and installs root dependencies
2. The `postinstall` script triggers `npm run build`
3. The build script runs `vite build` 
4. **FAILURE**: Vite cannot find client dependencies like `@dnd-kit/core`

The root cause was that the client directory has its own `package.json` with dependencies that were not being installed before the build process started.

## Solution

Modified `scripts/build.js` to install client dependencies before building:

```javascript
// 1. Install client dependencies FIRST
console.log('ðŸ“¦ Installing client dependencies...');
if (fs.existsSync('client/package.json')) {
  execSync('cd client && npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  console.log('âœ… Client dependencies installed');
}

// 2. Clean previous builds
// 3. Build client with Vite
// 4. Build server with TypeScript
```

## Changes Made

### 1. `scripts/build.js`
- Added step to install client dependencies before building
- Renumbered steps for clarity (1-5 instead of 1-4)
- Uses `npm ci` with `--prefer-offline` and `--no-audit` flags for faster, more reliable installs

### 2. `test-build-validation.js` (NEW)
- Created comprehensive build validation test
- Validates build script exists and has correct content
- Checks for required files and directories
- Can run on fresh clone or after build

### 3. `package.json`
- Added `test:build` script to run build validation

## Verification

The fix has been tested with:

âœ… Fresh clone with `npm ci`
âœ… Manual `npm run build`
âœ… Clean rebuild after removing dist and client/node_modules
âœ… Build validation test passes in all scenarios

## Build Output

After successful build:
```
dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              âœ… Client build
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/                 âœ… JS/CSS bundles
â””â”€â”€ server/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js                âœ… Server compiled
    â””â”€â”€ ...                     âœ… Other server files
```

## For Vercel Deployment

This fix ensures that:
1. The `postinstall` hook works correctly during Vercel deployment
2. Client dependencies are installed before Vite tries to build
3. Both client and server builds complete successfully
4. No manual intervention is needed

## Testing

Run the build validation test anytime:
```bash
npm run test:build
```

Or test the full build process:
```bash
npm run build
```
