# 3D Architecture Generator - Product Requirements Document

A browser-based 3D architecture generator that converts building blueprints into interactive 3D models with rooms, walls, and virtual tours.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Professional** - Clean, technical interface that instills confidence in architectural accuracy
2. **Intuitive** - Complex 3D generation made accessible through guided workflows
3. **Responsive** - Real-time feedback during analysis and model generation

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- Requires sophisticated image processing, 3D rendering, file management, and export capabilities

## Essential Features

### Blueprint Upload & Analysis
- **Functionality**: Upload PNG/JPG blueprints (max 16MB), automatic wall/room/door detection
- **Purpose**: Convert 2D architectural drawings into structured data for 3D generation
- **Trigger**: File drag-drop or browse button
- **Progression**: Upload → Analysis progress → Element detection results → 3D preview
- **Success criteria**: Accurate detection of walls, rooms, doors, windows with editable results

### 3D Model Generation
- **Functionality**: Generate realistic building geometry with configurable wall height/thickness
- **Purpose**: Create immersive 3D representations of architectural plans
- **Trigger**: Confirm analysis results and generate button
- **Progression**: Parameters input → 3D generation → Interactive preview → Export options
- **Success criteria**: Accurate 3D model with proper proportions and navigable interior

### Interactive 3D Editor
- **Functionality**: Edit walls, doors, windows directly in 3D view with real-time updates
- **Purpose**: Refine auto-generated models for accuracy and customization
- **Trigger**: Click elements in 3D view or use editing tools
- **Progression**: Select element → Edit properties → Real-time preview → Apply changes
- **Success criteria**: Smooth editing experience with immediate visual feedback

### Virtual Room Tours
- **Functionality**: Automatic camera waypoints for guided virtual building tours
- **Purpose**: Showcase architectural spaces with cinematic navigation
- **Trigger**: Play tour button or spacebar
- **Progression**: Tour start → Smooth camera movement → Room transitions → Tour complete
- **Success criteria**: Fluid camera movement with natural viewing angles

### Multi-Format Export
- **Functionality**: Export as OBJ, STL, PLY, and custom Blender/FreeCAD scripts
- **Purpose**: Enable use in professional CAD/3D software workflows
- **Trigger**: Export menu selection
- **Progression**: Format selection → Options configuration → File generation → Download
- **Success criteria**: Valid files that open correctly in target applications

## Edge Case Handling
- **Invalid blueprints**: Show analysis guidance and sample blueprint requirements
- **Large file uploads**: Progress indicators with size optimization suggestions
- **Complex floor plans**: Simplified detection with manual editing tools
- **Export failures**: Fallback formats and error messaging with retry options
- **Browser limitations**: WebGL fallbacks and performance warnings

## Design Direction
The design should feel cutting-edge and professional like high-end CAD software, with a technical aesthetic that conveys precision and capability while remaining approachable for non-experts.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme for visual hierarchy and technical sophistication.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (#1E40AF) - Technical precision and trust
- **Secondary Colors**: Steel Gray (#64748B) for UI elements, Charcoal (#374151) for text
- **Accent Color**: Electric Orange (#F97316) for calls-to-action and progress indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White #FFFFFF): Charcoal text (#374151) - Ratio 10.7:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray #F8FAFC): Charcoal text (#374151) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue #1E40AF): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 8.6:1 ✓
  - Accent (Electric Orange #F97316): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Technical precision with modern readability - using Inter for its engineering-focused design and excellent screen legibility.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Technical Labels: Inter Medium/12px/wide letter spacing

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that reinforce the technical precision theme while providing clear feedback for complex operations.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions communicate system reliability and professional quality
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Upload progress, 3D generation, and camera tours receive primary animation focus

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Dialog for settings, Card for file upload, Tabs for different views, Progress for analysis, Button variations for actions
- **Customizations**: Custom 3D viewer component, blueprint analyzer interface, export manager
- **States**: Clear loading/processing states for long operations, active tool indicators
- **Icon Selection**: Technical icons from Phosphor (blueprint, cube, download, edit)
- **Spacing**: Generous padding (p-6, p-8) for technical interfaces, tight spacing (gap-2, gap-4) for tool groups
- **Mobile**: Simplified 3D controls, collapsible panels, touch-optimized editing tools
